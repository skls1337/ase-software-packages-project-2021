Software Packages Project

# Requirements
The seminar activity will be finalized with a project.  
 
The project will use MS Excel, Python and SAS program packages in order to analyze the activity and the expansion possibilities of an organization.  
 
The project will be made individually or in groups of 2 students for the same organization.  
 
For each program package it is mandatory to use at least the following functionalities: 
 
Excel: 4 of the following capabilities (combined or used separately): LOOKUP functions, financial functions, logical functions, statistical functions, user-defined functions, macros, Pivot Table, Goalseek, Scenario, Solver, Subtotals, Charts. 
 
SAS Enterprise Guide: 
-	importing a non-SAS file 
-	queries 
-	joins 
-	using prompts 
-	a report 
-	a chart 
-	a statistical processing 
-	user defined formats 
-	creating a composed document 
-	user-defined styles 
 
SAS programming: combined or used separately, use minimum 6 of the following facilities: creating a SAS data set from external files, creating and using user-defined formats, iterative and conditional processing of data, creating data subsets, using SAS functions, combining data sets with specific SAS and SQL procedures, using arrays, using report procedures, using statistical procedures, generating graphs. 
 
Python programming, combined or used separately, use minimum 6 of the following facilities: 
-	using lists and dictionaries, including their specific methods; 
-	using sets and tuples, including their specific methods; 
-	defining and calling some functions; 
-	using conditional structures; 
-	using repetitive structures; 
-	importing a csv or json file into the pandas package; 
-	accessing data with loc and iloc; 
-	modifying data in the pandas package; 
-	using group functions; 
-	dealing with missing values; 
-	deleting columns and records; 
-	statistical processing, grouping and aggregation of data in the pandas package; 
-	processing of data sets with merge / join; 
-	graphical representation of the data with the matplotlib package; - using scikit-learn package (clustering, logistic regression); - using statmodels package (multiple regression). 
 
The project will be written in MS Word, will be organized on software packages and functions, and for each function you will specify: a) Defining the problem 
b)	Information required for solving 
c)	Calculation methods, algorithms, calculation formulas used (as appropriate) 
d)	Presentation of results (screen shot) 
e)	Economic interpretation of results 
The project will be electronically and will contain the Word document, the Excel file, in which the Excel exercises were solved, and the specific files for working in SAS and Python.  
 
The project will be archived and uploaded on online.ase.ro. Also, all the files belonging to a project will be included in a folder that has the complete name of the author(s) and their group.  
 
The project team must be announced in the first seminars (here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nkkodX400Kn6tqb6NLk54dTvAhZGGA _tLrJHoK7PV4o/edit#gid=0) and cannot be changed.  
 
The organization that was chosen for exemplifying the exercises cannot be changed during developing the project.  
 
 
Identical projects will have 0 points, even if at a previous evaluation they received another scoring.  
 
The projects are uploaded when the seminar teacher specifies for each group.  
 
The quiz exam on the computer - 50.00 % of the final grade 
 
The project is 30.00 % of the final grade  
 
The ability to use software packages – practical exam - 20.00 % of the final grade  
 
Theoretical elements – minimum 5 out of 10 
 
The ability to use software packages – mandatory condition for passing the exam  
 
Project – minimum 5 out of 10; condition for accepting the project: using all software packages presented at the seminar  
 
Note: in the summer exam session, the students that didn’t get at least 5 at the seminar, must present the project and/or take the seminar test in the exam day.
